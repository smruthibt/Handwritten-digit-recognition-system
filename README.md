# Handwritten-digit-recognition-system
1.The project of hand-written digit recognition mainly includes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm of machine learning. 2.CNN applies to image processing , natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks. 3.The model mainly recognises the hand-written digit and matches with that of the actual value and gives the accuracy of the digit. 4.The model includes the open-source neural-network library named keras and various functions in keras , also includes matplot.lib and numpy.

***ABOUT THE MODEL***

Firstly we load the data and split it into testing and training data sets. We print the image of the shape. Show the image as a picture. Reshape the data to fit the model (Processing the data). Perform one-hot encoding to the test and train labels. Now we build the CNN model using sequential and add the layers to the model. Compile the model. Train the model. Visualize the accuracy of the model. Show predictions of the model as probabilities in the test set. Print the predictions as the number of labels, also print the actual labels. Compare the digits predicted with that of the actual values and see how correctly we have predicted the digit. Show the images as pictures.

***ADVANTAGES OF THIS MODEL***

The system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing style.

The generative model can perform recognition driven segmentation

The method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is relatively easy and fast .

Unlike many other recognition schemes it does not rely on some form of pre-normalisation of input images , but can handle arbitrary scalings.

We have demonstrated that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima.
